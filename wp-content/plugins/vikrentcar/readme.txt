== Description ==

= Vik Rent Car for WordPress =

The popular car rental management system is now available also for WordPress as a Native Plugin!

If you are looking for a reliable reservation system for renting cars, scooter, motorbikes, boats or any other vehicles, then you have found the right plugin. In fact, Vik Rent Car is a famous piece of software used by thousands of car rental companies worldwide every day.

It's definitely the car rental plugin that you, or your client, were looking for.

This is the **free** version of the plugin, but you can upgrade to the **Pro** version at any time from your *wp-admin* section. Experience the power of a robust vehicles rental management system!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is upgrading to Pro mandatory? =

No, not at all. However, it took our company around 8 years to build the *Pro* version and we are willing to spend a lot more years of work on this software. We encourage you to evaluate the free version first, and then upgrade to Pro to unlock its potential.

= Why some functions are not available in the free version? =

We are a software development company that constantly works to deliver professional tools to build up websites. We make money by selling licenses of the Pro version.

= Is it worth upgrading to Pro? =

VikRentCar is not a one-page plugin. You can build websites worth a lot of money with this plugin. You don't need anything else to deliver a complete website, if not a Theme and some experience with WordPress.

= Can I use VikRentCar with my preferred Theme? =

Yes, of course. You are free to install Vik Rent Car on your website with your own Theme. The plugin will adjust to it thanks to its own CSS framework. It is also possible to work on a custom CSS file to adjust some layouts.

= How's the availability of the vehicles calculated? =

You can create several vehicles through the back-end, each with a total number of units available. Optionally, these cars can be assigned to one or more locations for pick up and drop off. The system will calculate the remaining availability at "vehicle level", meaning that depending on how many vehicles have been booked for some days of the year with "Confirmed" orders, the system will be able to determine how many units are left for a certain vehicle. The locations selected for drop off or pick up will not affect this calculation. For example, if you have 5 units availble of a specific car, and if this car is booked for next weekend by one customer, those days/times will have 4 units left for booking.
