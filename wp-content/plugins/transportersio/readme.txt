== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who should install our plugin =

Our plugin is only useful for subscribers of [Transporters.io](https://transporters.io/wordpress/)
Our software comes with a free trial to see if it works for you, so if you run a transport company but don't yet use Transporters why not give it a try.

= What if I already use another system? =

Unfortunately this plugin only works with Transporters.io so you wont be able to connect it to your existing transportation booking management system.

However Transporters.io is very easy to learn, very powerful and the most affordable product on the market.
If you have access to your existing data we can assist with getting your past bookings moved across making the switch very simple.

So if you currently use distinctive systems, sengario, ecoachmanager, roeville, dte, the booking system, Hudson Group HGTS, alp systems or any other dispatch / despatch solution we suggest you signup for a free trial, give Transporters.io a test and speak to our helpful staff about switch over!
