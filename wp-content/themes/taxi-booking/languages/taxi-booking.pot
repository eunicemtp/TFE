#. Description of the theme
#: style.css
msgid "Taxi Booking is a great WordPress theme that has a professional design for representing taxi booking services, cab service, transfer and travel business, online auto and cabs, cars, cab drivers, and more. For a sophisticated finish, it comes with a minimal design and highlights your business values in the best possible ways. It has a clean, responsive, and retina-ready design that gives a seamless display of your website and doesnâ€™t get any of your content cropped. Moreover, it is made user-friendly to give an out-of-the-box experience to beginners as they do not need to write codes. Call to Action Button (CTA) will add more value to your website as it will help improve the conversion rates. There are SEO-friendly codes in the design that will make it useful for bringing better traffic flows. Social media icons are also available in the design to bring you more options for promotion. The highly optimized codes result in a lightweight design that is easy to load and gives a faster page load time. As this free theme is designed using a powerful Bootstrap framework, you will get to easily customize a few aspects thanks to the personalization options made available by the theme options panel."
